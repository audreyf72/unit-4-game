Crystals Collector Game

You are given a random number to match at the start of the game.
There are four crystals below. Each crystal is worth an undisclosed 
number of points and clicking on a crystal will add those points to
your score.

You win the game by matching your score exactly to the random number. 
You will lose the game if your score goes above the random number.

When the game restarts, the number to match will change and the number 
of points for each crystal will change as well.

--Problems with coding the game---

I was able to set up the framework in HTML and CSS with no issue. I'm struggling with the Javascript and Jquery portion. 

I've checked the logic and am getting no errors in the console inspector. According to the console log the random number is being generated and displayed. Also, the four random numbers to be assigned to the crystals are also being generated. But the values are not being assigned to the crystals or registered when the crystals are clicked. To this end, I'm unable to see is the wins and losses are being recorded or if the game reset is working. 

I will continue to try running each section independently to isolate the issue so I can focus on fixing just that part. Once I get it working I will put it back into my game.js file and see if the rest will run with the corrected portion.
