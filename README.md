Crystals Collector Game

You are given a random number to match at the start of the game.
There are four crystals below. Each crystal is worth an undisclosed 
number of points and clicking on a crystal will add those points to
your score.

You win the game by matching your score exactly to the random number. 
You will lose the game if your score goes above the random number.

When the game restarts, the number to match will change and the number 
of points for each crystal will change as well.

--Problems with coding the game---

I was able to fix the issues with assigning values to each crystal. My remaining issue is that the random number generated at the start of the game doesn't stay within the parameters, between 19 to 120. I'm still working on that problem.
