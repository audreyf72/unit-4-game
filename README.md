Crystals Collector Game

Radom selector game using HTML, CSS, Javascript and jQuery.

The player is given a random number to match at the start of the game.
There are four crystals to click on. Each crystal is worth an undisclosed 
number of points and clicking on a crystal will add those points to
The players score.

The player wins the game by matching the score exactly to the random number. 
They will lose the game if the score exceeds the random number.

When the game restarts, the win or loss is logged in the player stats, the random number will change, the value of each crystal will change, and the player score will reset to zero.
